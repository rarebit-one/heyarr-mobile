# heyarr-mobile

The first-party **Android client for [heyarr](https://github.com/rarebit-one/heyarr-core)** —
the self-hosted media platform. Voidbind **QR** sign-in, a native **library browse**, and the
seams for **device-side personal state** (decrypt-on-device) that make this the *product*
client rather than a generic Subsonic app.

This is a **scaffold** — a buildable, tested foundation, not a finished app.

## What's here

| Area | State | Where |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Auth** | Two credential shapes — primary `Authorization: Device <cert>~<proof>` and bootstrap `Bearer` (QR session). Header formatting real + tested; the in-enclave proof is phone-gated. | `auth/` |
| **Login** | Voidbind **QR** seam (heyarr's channel). Real initiator `POST /login` + poll `GET /login/{id}` → Bearer token. QR bitmap render + device-side approve are follow-ups. | `login/` |
| **Library** | `LibraryClient` against the native `GET /api/v1/works`, auth header + tolerant parse, wired to a browse list. Subsonic reach is a documented stub. | `library/` |
| **Playback** | A **Media3/ExoPlayer** player streaming `/api/v1/blobs/{hash}/content` over an OkHttp-backed data source with the auth header + native **Range/206** seek (the M10 win); transport controls for audio **and** video; wired to tap-an-item-to-play. The URL/plan/target logic is unit-tested; a real codec decoding on a device is the phone-gated half. | `playback/` |
| **Personal state** | `/api/v1/spaces/{id}/{keys,changes,snapshot}` fetched as **opaque ciphertext**; a fail-closed `Unwrapper` decrypt-on-device seam. **No crypto in this repo.** | `personalstate/` |

## Relationship to the other repos

- **[`rarebit-one/heyarr-core`](https://github.com/rarebit-one/heyarr-core)** (PUBLIC / AGPL) —
  the server this talks to. The **contract** this client builds against is
  `heyarr-core/docs/design/mobile-client.md` (device auth ADR-0048, personal state
  ADR-0049/0051). **No server change is needed** to add this client.
- **[`rarebit-one/voidbind-kmp`](https://github.com/rarebit-one/voidbind-kmp)** — THE Voidbind
  authenticator app (**Cruciform**, `one.rarebit.cruciform`) + the shared `voidbind-client` (`WebLoginClient`, `LoginQr`, `WebLogin`,
  `LoginApproval`). This app delegates login approval to that authenticator.

### voidbind-kmp consumption

This app depends on the **published** shared client,
`one.rarebit.voidbind:voidbind-client:0.5.0` (GitHub Packages, private — a token with
`read:packages` is required even for a same-org read). `settings.gradle.kts` reads
`gpr.user` / `gpr.token` from `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`, or `GITHUB_ACTOR` /
`GITHUB_TOKEN` from the environment; CI passes its own workflow token. Locally:

```sh
GITHUB_ACTOR=<your login> GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug
```

`login/` is now a thin façade over the library's `WebLoginClient` / `LoginQr`, and the
device credential is real: the library's `auth/{PossessionProof, DeviceCredential,
DeviceAuthPolicy}` mint heyarr's possession proof byte-for-byte (the Go-minted golden
vectors stay pinned in this repo's `PossessionProofTest`) and sign it with the phone's
hardware-sealed key (`device/DeviceKeyring` → voidbind-client `DeviceKeyStore`); the
app reuses one proof for ~1 h (`reuseForSeconds`) and re-mints + retries once on a 401.
Since 0.5.0 (voidbind-kmp ADR-0005) the credential token is this device's **admitting
op** and the app also holds the identity's membership **ops** (its replica): they ride
every Device request as `Voidbind-Membership` (`device/MembershipOps` picks ≤ 64) and
`POST /enrol {…, ops}`, and after a 401 the app re-reads `GET /membership/{usr}` so a
device another member removed shows an honest "removed" state instead of looping.

## Build / test

```sh
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest      # pure-JVM unit tests (login state machine, works parse, URLs, credential)
./gradlew assembleDebug          # debug APK
```

Requires JDK 17+ and an Android SDK (API 35). Point `local.properties` at your SDK
(`sdk.dir=…`) — CI provisions it via `android-actions/setup-android`.

## Phone-gated follow-ups (deferred by design)

These need real hardware / a live server and can't be proven in CI:

- **On-device playback acceptance** — the Media3/ExoPlayer pipeline over
  `/api/v1/blobs/{hash}/content` (Range + `Authorization`) now **ships** (`playback/`), but a
  real codec decoding the stream and a scrub issuing live 206 range reads can only be proven on
  a device/emulator. The `POST /api/v1/playback` transcode/remux negotiation is wired
  (`PlaybackClient.plan`) but keyed on an enrolled `device_id`, so it goes live with device auth.
- **Device-cert login** — now **ships**: the sealed-key possession proof, the pairing
  handshake (`device/`, this phone = the NEW device joining a v3 invite that Cruciform
  or `voidbind pair-initiate` rendered) and re-mint-on-401. What is still gated on the
  *server*: `POST /enrol` taking `ops` and `GET /membership/{usr}` (heyarr-core ADR-0068,
  PR #426 — until it lands the app retries `/enrol` without `ops` and treats a 404 on
  `/membership` as "nothing learned"), or an admin registering the op
  (`POST /api/v1/identities/devices`), and write scope for a device (heyarr-core #417 +
  `POST /api/v1/session/management-grants`). Completing a pairing needs a member device
  on the other side, so it is proven on-device, not in CI. Honest key tier on
  the Nothing Phone (2a): **TEE**, not StrongBox.
- **On-device personal-state decrypt** — the real `Unwrapper` (X25519 ECDH in-enclave → HKDF →
  the space key) + AEAD decryption of opaque changes, and the local **Personal MCP** (#372/#387)
  that reads the decrypted state. **No crypto ships in this repo.**
- **Subsonic/OPDS/DLNA reach** — deciding whether to ship the compat adapters at all vs. leaning
  on the native API; `library/SubsonicClient` marks the fork as a decision, not an omission.

## Releases — signed APKs, published per tag

Debug builds are a dead end: they are signed with the throwaway debug key, so they can
never be updated in place by a real release. Every tagged version is therefore built as
a **signed release APK** and attached to a GitHub Release, which is the artefact the
phone installs.

### Cutting a release

```sh
git tag v0.2.1          # `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
git push origin v0.2.1
```

`.github/workflows/release.yml` picks the tag up, builds `:app:assembleRelease`, verifies the
APK with `apksigner verify --print-certs`, and publishes the Release with
`heyarr-mobile-0.2.1.apk` attached. `versionName` comes from the tag; `versionCode` is derived from it
(`major*10000 + minor*100 + patch`), so neither is ever hand-edited.

### Signing

`signingConfigs.release` reads four values, from the environment first and gradle
properties second — nothing is committed, and `*.jks` is git-ignored:

| Env | Gradle property | What |
|-----|-----------------|------|
| `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | `release.keystoreBase64` | the keystore, base64 |
| `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | `release.keystorePassword` | store password |
| `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS` | `release.keyAlias` | `one.rarebit.heyarr.mobile` |
| `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` | `release.keyPassword` | key password |

With none of them set the release build type is simply **unsigned** — a local
`assembleRelease` still works. CI supplies them from the repo secrets of the same
names. The keystore itself (RSA 4096, 25 years) lives at
`~/.config/rarebit-android-signing/heyarr-mobile.jks` and in **1Password → Sysadmins**.
Losing it means no user can ever update in place again.

Build a signed APK locally:

```sh
export RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64=$(base64 -i ~/.config/rarebit-android-signing/heyarr-mobile.jks | tr -d '\n')
export RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=$(cat ~/.config/rarebit-android-signing/heyarr-mobile.password)
export RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD="$RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"
export RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=one.rarebit.heyarr.mobile
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease -PreleaseVersionName=v0.2.1
```

### Getting it onto a phone

Download the APK from the Release and `adb install` it, or open the Release page on
the phone. There is deliberately no third-party app-store client in the loop.

How this is *meant* to be distributed — a self-hosted install page plus an in-app
updater that checks for and applies a new signed build — is being designed in
[`rarebit-one/heyarr-core#441`](https://github.com/rarebit-one/heyarr-core/issues/441).
Not built yet; this section is the pointer, not the plan.
