/**
 * One hit from a **source-agnostic content search**. The user types what they want
 * (a show, a movie, a podcast, a channel); heyarr resolves it against the catalogue
 * and returns works — this is a thin projection of one, deliberately mirroring
 * [one.rarebit.heyarr.mobile.library.Work] but carrying the extra fields a "what do I
 * want to acquire" list needs (a [year] to disambiguate, a [posterUrl] when the
 * server has one).
 *
 * Crucially there is **no indexer/source field**: the user expresses intent, the
 * server routes to sources. A result is something you can then **Get once** (a
 * one-off acquisition) or **Follow** (an ongoing subscription) — see [AcquireClient].
 *
 * [workId] is heyarr's work id (from `GET /api/v1/works`), the handle a one-off want
 * points at. [type] is the server's `content_type` (movie, series, podcast, …) and
 * is the hint for whether Following (ongoing) makes sense.
