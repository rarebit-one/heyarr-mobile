/**
 * Everything a player needs to start streaming one item: WHERE the bytes are, WHICH
 * credential authorises the pull, and enough about the media to configure the player
 * (video vs. audio, an optional MIME hint, whether a scrub is honest).
 *
 * A **direct** target's [contentUrl] is the range-capable blob endpoint
 * (`/api/v1/blobs/{hash}/content`, ADR-0013) — the player issues `Range` requests
 * against it and the server answers `206 Partial Content`, which is what lets a
 * scrub seek without pulling the whole file (the M10 win). A **stream** target
 * (heyarr-core #432/#433, `mode: "stream"`) is a fragmented-MP4 the node repackages
 * for this phone as it goes — same origin, same credential on every read.
 *
 * A stream has **no native seek** (no `Content-Length`, no ranges), so [seekable] is
 * false and the player hides the scrubber. But ADR-0069 gives it a *restart* seek:
 * re-request the same HMAC token'd URL with `?start=<seconds>` and ffmpeg restarts
 * from that instant. [restartSeekable] marks a stream that can do this; [streamBaseUrl]
 * is the token URL WITHOUT any `start` (so a re-seek always builds off the base, never
 * off a URL that already carries one) and [streamStartSeconds] is where the current
 * repackage began in the source. [streamUrl] builds the `?start=` URL — appending a
 * query param and never percent-encoding the path token (the #16 `blake3:`→`blake3%3A`
 * trap: the token goes on the wire verbatim).
 *
 * The type is pure and unit-tested; feeding it into a real ExoPlayer/Media3 pipeline
 * is the phone-gated half (a codec + a surface only exist on a device).
