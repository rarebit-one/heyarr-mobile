/**
 * A source the user is subscribed to — one row of the "Following" list. Models the
 * live `FollowedSourceView` (`GET /api/v1/followed-sources`, heyarr-core
 * `internal/api/resources/followed.go`): a subscription that projects new
 * `DesiredItem`s over time. Its [id], the [workId] it follows, its inferred [type],
 * the [feedRef] it is polled through, the profile/monitor/backfill it was created
 * with, the archive's running counters ([itemsKnown] enumerated, [itemsArchived]
 * captured), [health] (`healthy`/`unhealthy`/`unknown`) and the poll timestamps.
 *
 * The server view carries no human title (only a `work_id`), so [title] falls back to
 * the work id for display until a work→title lookup is wired; that is what the
 * Following screen shows.
