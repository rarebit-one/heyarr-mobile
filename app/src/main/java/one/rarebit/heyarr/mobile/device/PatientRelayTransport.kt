/**
 * Stretches voidbind-client's relay poll to the relay session's TTL.
 *
 * The library's `RelayClient.fetch` gives up on a peer slot after a fixed 60 s of 404s
 * (`maxWaitMillis`, not reachable through `DevicePairing`) — 401 polls at 150 ms,
 * exactly the count the node's relay log showed for the failed same-phone pairing:
 * Cruciform on this phone had not posted its reveal yet because the human was busy
 * creating the key / comparing / confirming over there. The relay itself keeps a
 * session for ten minutes, so this wrapper makes every GET that 404s **keep polling
 * on its own** until the slot fills, a non-404 answer arrives, or [deadlineMillis]
 * passes — at which point it throws the library's own [RelayTimeout], so
 * `PairingFailures` still classifies it as `TIMEOUT` (distinct from unreachable, which
 * surfaces as whatever the inner transport throws on the first call). The library's
 * counter then never reaches 60 s: to it, one poll simply took a while.
 *
 * Interruptible: the sleep is a plain `Thread.sleep` whose `InterruptedException` is
 * let through, so a `runInterruptible` cancel tears the wait down at once.
