/**
 * Turns an opaque CRDT entry id into something the Playlist / Starred / Recently
 * readers can display (issue #41, Option B). It branches on the [ItemRef] kind:
 *
 *  - `work`  → `GET /works/{id}` (the historical path, unchanged).
 *  - `asset` → resolve the file to its work: `GET /assets/{id}` → its `edition_id` →
 *    `GET /editions/{id}` → its `work_id` → `GET /works/{id}`, carrying the [WorkAsset]
 *    back so a caller can show the track title and play the file itself.
 *  - `item`  → the same asset→work resolution (an episode / feed item is a file too),
 *    falling back to a work lookup if the id turns out to be a work after all.
 *
 * A legacy untagged id decodes as a work, so nothing stored before this change breaks.
 * Any read that fails (a 404, a deleted file, a work this device cannot see) resolves
 * to `null`; the readers already drop a null rather than paint a broken row.
