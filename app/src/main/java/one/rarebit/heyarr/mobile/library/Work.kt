/**
 * A library entry as browsed from heyarr's native resources API
 * (`GET /api/v1/works`, `GET /api/v1/works/{id}` — heyarr-core `Work`). A thin
 * projection — id, a display title, a kind, a year, the normalised [workKey] and the
 * server timestamps (which drive the settings-free "recent first" order) — of the far
 * richer server model (§ works/editions/assets). The work's assets, wants and
 * followed source are loaded separately by the detail screen ([WorkDetailClient]).
 *
 * [blobHash] / [mime] are the OPTIONAL playback handles: when a browse row carries a
 * primary asset's content hash, the M10 player can stream it directly
 * (`/api/v1/blobs/{hash}/content`) — that is the "tap → it plays" path. The live
 * `Work` view does not inline one, so the detail screen's asset list is where Play
 * actually lives; the row keeps the handle for a server that does inline it.
