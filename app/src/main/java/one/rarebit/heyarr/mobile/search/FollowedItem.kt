 * One item a followed source's feed has yielded — heyarr-core `FollowedItem`
 * (`GET /api/v1/followed-sources/{id}/items`, #430, ADR-0056). It is the archive a
 * person reads to answer "what has this subscription actually got me": each item is
 * the source-stable [itemKey] (an `S02E05`, a podcast GUID, a video id) with a [title]
 * and, when the source projected one, the item-scoped [want] and whether heyarr holds
 * bytes for it ([archived]).
 *
 * [want] is **null** for an item no want was projected for — a `backfill=from_now`
 * source knows about back-catalogue episodes it deliberately did not ask for, and
 * reporting them rather than omitting them is what makes this an archive and not a
 * queue.
