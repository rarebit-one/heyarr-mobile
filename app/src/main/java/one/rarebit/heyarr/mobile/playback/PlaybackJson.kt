/**
 * A minimal, dependency-free reader for `POST /api/v1/playback/plan` (heyarr-core
 * #432) — kept JVM-testable (no `org.json`, stubbed in unit tests) for the same
 * reason as [one.rarebit.heyarr.mobile.library.WorksJson].
 *
 * The contract: `{ "mode": "direct" | "stream", "url", "mime", "reason",
 * "source": { container, video, audio, width, height } }`. `direct` means play the
 * blob as-is; `stream` means play [Plan.url] as a fragmented-MP4 progressive stream
 * the node repackages for this phone (no seeking in v1). The pre-#432 shape
 * (`decision: "DIRECT"` + `content_url`) is still read as a direct plan so a node
 * mid-rollout cannot make a playable asset look unplayable.
 *
 * When a generated client lands (kotlinx.serialization against the published
 * OpenAPI), swap this for it.
