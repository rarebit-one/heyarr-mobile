/**
 * The enrolment flow's automatic steps, as pure decisions so they are unit-tested
 * without a keyring or a relay. The same-phone path (Cruciform's "Add a device" →
 * "Send to heyarr") asks the human for nothing in this app: the invite provisions the
 * key, the key joins the invite, the registered admission signs the phone in. The
 * human's one decision — allowing the device — is taken in Cruciform, behind its
 * biometric. Cross-device pairing (a scanned or pasted invite) still stops at the
 * security-code comparison, which is the boundary against a relay in the middle.
