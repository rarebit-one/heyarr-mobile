/**
 * The two acquisition intents behind a search result, and where each one goes on the
 * wire. This is the UI counterpart of heyarr's MCP acquisition verbs.
 *
 * - **[getOnce]** — a **one-off** acquisition: "get me this, once." Wire target
 *   **exists today**: `POST /api/v1/desired` with `monitor:false` (heyarr-core
 *   `internal/api/resources/desired.go` `createDesired` → `WantContentRequest`; the
 *   REST form of the MCP `want_content` verb). A one-off is exactly `monitor:false`:
 *   want it, acquire it, then stop looking (§60 keeps monitoring first-class, so the
 *   one-off is the deliberate opt-out).
 *
 * - **[follow]** — an **ongoing subscription**: "follow this source and keep
 *   archiving whatever it emits." Wire target is now **live** (M12 Slice 5):
 *   `POST /api/v1/followed-sources` with a `FollowSourceRequest` body ⇒ `201`
 *   `FollowedSource` (+ `Location`) — heyarr-core `internal/api/resources/followed.go`
 *   `FollowSource`/`createFollowedSource`.
 *
 *   **Phase-1 reality:** a followed source needs a *feed identity* the server can
 *   poll — a `tvdb_id` or a TVDB `url` — and only `tv_series` is implemented; anything
 *   else (or a work with no feed identity) is **refused server-side** with a `400`
 *   whose `detail` explains why. A search result carries a `work_id` but no feed
 *   identity, so a bare follow of a search hit is refused today. Per the brief we do
 *   **not pre-filter** — we send the intent and surface the server's `detail` as a
 *   user-visible [Result.Failed], and accept an optional [tvdbId]/[url] so a caller
 *   that has one can follow for real.
 *
 * The distinction is the whole feature: a one-off is a single `DesiredItem`; a follow
 * is a `FollowedSource` that *projects* new `DesiredItem`s forever.
