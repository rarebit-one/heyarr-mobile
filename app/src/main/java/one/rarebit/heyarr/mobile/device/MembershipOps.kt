/**
 * Which of the membership ops this device knows it **presents** beside its `Device`
 * credential — the `Voidbind-Membership` header on every request, and `ops` in the
 * `POST /enrol` body (voidbind-kmp ADR-0005 / heyarr-core ADR-0068).
 *
 * A relying party merges what a device presents with its own log before evaluating,
 * so a device admitted by a phone the node has never met still authenticates on
 * first contact — but it accepts at most [DeviceCredential.MAX_PRESENTED_OPS] (64);
 * more is a refusal, not a truncation. While the replica fits, everything is
 * presented (in hash order, the CRDT's canonical order). Once it does not, the ops
 * that **justify this device's own admission** come first — the admitting op and
 * its transitive `prev` ancestry, the causal chain the RP needs to find the admitter
 * a member — and the rest fill the remaining room in hash order.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, nothing re-derived about the wire (the op parser is the library's).
