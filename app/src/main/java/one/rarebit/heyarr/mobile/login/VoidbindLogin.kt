/**
 * The app's Voidbind QR-login seam. heyarr's login channel is **QR** (plan
 * DECISIONS LOG: "heyarr login channel = QR"). The app is the *initiator* — the
 * relying party (RP): it asks heyarr's weblogin broker to start a login, renders the
 * returned `voidbind:login?rp=&id=` tuple as a QR code for the user's authenticator
 * to scan, and polls until the broker reports the login approved, receiving a
 * short-lived **Bearer** session token (bootstrap credential — see
 * `auth/Credential.Session`).
 *
 * The wire brain is voidbind-client's `WebLoginClient` (published from voidbind-kmp;
 * byte-identical to voidbind-go's `weblogin` handler). [QrLoginClient] is the app's
 * state machine over its `createLogin`/`poll` calls; the device-side approval half
 * (scan → hardware-gated sign → approve) belongs to the authenticator app, not this
 * consumption client.
