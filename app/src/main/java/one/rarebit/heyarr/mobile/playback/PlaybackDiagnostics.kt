/**
 * Turns what Media3 reports about a stream into an HONEST message, instead of the
 * silent-audio / black-surface it produces on its own. Pure: the `Player.Listener`
 * in [PlayerScreen] flattens `Tracks` into [TrackGroup]s and hands them here, so the
 * "AC-3 5.1 can't be decoded" verdict is unit-tested, not discovered on a phone.
 *
 * Three failure shapes, all real on the Nothing Phone:
 *  - an audio (or video) track group the phone has no decoder for — Media3 keeps
 *    playing the other renderer and says nothing ([assess]);
 *  - a decoder/renderer failure at prepare/first-frame — a black surface with no
 *    error ([describeError]);
 *  - a container the extractor accepts but yields no video frames from (AVI:
 *    H.264 + MP2, heyarr-core #432) — duration shown, picture never arrives
 *    ([noFrameMessage] after [NO_FRAME_GRACE_MS] of READY).
