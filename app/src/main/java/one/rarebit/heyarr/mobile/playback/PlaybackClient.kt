/**
 * The playback / blob-stream seam. heyarr serves content two ways (mobile-client
 * contract + heyarr-core #432):
 *
 *  - **Direct blob stream** — `GET /api/v1/blobs/{hash}/content`, a range-capable
 *    byte hop the player pulls from, authenticated with the caller's [Credential].
 *    ExoPlayer's HTTP data source handles the `Range`/`206` seek itself.
 *  - **Planned playback** — `POST /api/v1/playback/plan {asset_id, client}` with this
 *    phone's REAL capabilities ([ClientCapabilities]); the node answers `direct`
 *    (play the blob) or `stream` (play a phone-friendly fMP4 it repackages, same
 *    origin, same credential, no seeking in v1). [resolve] is the one entry point:
 *    it plans, and **falls back to the direct blob exactly as before** when the node
 *    predates the contract (a 400 on the new fields) — or cannot be asked at all.
 *
 * What is proven in CI here (pure, unit-tested): the content URL, the auth header,
 * the plan request body, the plan reader, and the fallback. What is phone-gated:
 * a real codec decoding the bytes.
