/**
 * The **same-phone one-tap** report this app fires back at Cruciform (voidbind-kmp
 * ADR-0008), and the URI shape it travels in.
 *
 * Cruciform hands us an invite by `heyarr-mobile://pair?invite=…` when both apps are on
 * one phone (ADR-0006). Once we have joined that invite — our relay commit posted, the
 * SAS derived — we tell Cruciform, over a LOCAL intent the relay cannot touch:
 *
 *     cruciform://pair-joined?session=<relay session>&dev=<our ed25519:… key>&sas=<our SAS>
 *
 * Cruciform compares those against what the relay revealed for the same session and, on
 * a match, asks the human ONE question behind its biometric instead of making them read
 * seven digits off two screens. Nothing here is secret: `dev` is a public key we already
 * committed to on the relay, `sas` is derived from both sides' public keys and the
 * invite salt, and `session` came out of the invite Cruciform sent us. The admission
 * still arrives sealed over the relay; this channel carries no authority at all.
 *
 * **Only for a deep-linked invite.** An invite that was scanned or pasted came from
 * another device, where there is no local channel and the human comparison is the whole
 * point — those keep the SAS, unchanged.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin (no `android.*`) so the URI shape is unit-tested on the JVM.
