/**
 * Where a work's poster is fetched from (heyarr-core ADR-0075).
 *
 * A row that carried the `artwork` embed names the blob route directly — no redirect,
 * and a URL keyed by the hash, which is what makes the image cache honest. A row
 * that did not (an older node, or a list read without `include=`) falls back to
 * `GET /works/{id}/artwork`, which 307s to the same place or 404s; the Poster
 * composable renders a placeholder on either failure. Pure, unit-tested.
